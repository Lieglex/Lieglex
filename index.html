    <h2>What is Lieglex?</h2>
    <p>
        <b>Lieglex</b> is an intelligent software solution designed to help organizations such as NGOs, hospitals, schools, prisons, and shelters optimize food management.
        <br><br>
        Every day, these organizations must decide how to provide balanced meals to hundreds of people while managing a fluctuating food supply and staying within budget.
        <br><br>
        Lieglex automates this process, eliminating guesswork and manual calculations. Organizations simply input their available food resources and nutritional needs, and our system determines the optimal food distribution strategy.
        <br><br>
        By leveraging mathematical optimization, Lieglex minimizes costs while ensuring that all individuals receive the best possible nutrition. Additionally, it reduces food waste and supports the United Nations' Zero Hunger (SDG 2) goal, especially in developing countries.

            <h2>1: Tell us about your Organization</h2>
            <p class="container_text">
                The first step is gathering essential information about your organization, including its type, operational location, and budget constraints.
                <br><br>
                This allows us to tailor the best experience for you, ensuring that your customers receive a highly optimized meal plan while your organization benefits from an efficient logistics strategy.

            <h2>2: Upload your food resources</h2>
            <p class="container_text">
                You can quickly register food products using our barcode scanner, powered by the <a href="https://world.openfoodfacts.org/">Open Food Facts</a> API, which recognizes over 3,668,481 products worldwide.
                <br><br>
                If your product is not in the database or lacks a barcode, you can manually enter it. Once uploaded, the system collects critical data such as:
                <br><br>
            <ul>
                <li>Product name</li>
                <li>Weight or volume</li>
                <li>Nutritional content</li>
                <li>Expiration date</li>
                <li>Unique identification code</li>
            </ul>
            With this structured data, Lieglex can process your inventory and optimize its use.

            <h2>3: Data Analysis & Inventory Processing</h2>
            <p class="container_text">
                After scanning your food products, the information is processed in real-time using Railway, our cloud-based platform. Railway performs the following actions:
                <br><br>
            <ul>
                <li>Verifies the product in the database and updates inventory quantities.</li>
                <li>Retrieves missing nutritional information from global food databases.</li>
                <li>Monitors expiration dates to prioritize food usage before spoilage.</li>
            </ul>
            This ensures that organizations always make informed decisions based on up-to-date inventory records.

            <h2>4: Advanced Optimization with Wolfram</h2>
            <p class="container_text">
                Using Wolfram’s cutting-edge computational capabilities, Lieglex determines the most efficient way to distribute food. The system answers key questions such as:
                <br><br>
            <ul>
                <li>How should food be allocated to maximize nutrition?</li>
                <li>What combinations of ingredients minimize costs and waste?</li>
                <li>What are the average nutritional values of the optimized diets?</li>
            </ul>
            By applying linear programming and advanced mathematical models, Wolfram finds the best balance between nutrition, cost, and availability.

            <h2>5: Real-Time Insights & Decision Making</h2>
            <p class="container_text">
                Once the optimization process is complete, Lieglex provides actionable insights through a user-friendly interface. Organizations can access:
                <br><br>
            <ul>
                <li>Updated inventory status in real-time.</li>
                <li>Alerts about products nearing expiration.</li>
                <li>Recommendations for optimal food distribution.</li>
                <li>Personalized meal plans based on available food resources.</li>
            </ul>
            This helps organizations make smarter decisions, improving food security and efficiency.
